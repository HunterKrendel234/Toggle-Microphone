# Toggle-Microphone
This project is a small utility that helps you quickly mute and unmute your microphone system-wide on Windows. Unlike hardware touch buttons that may accidentally unmute the mic due to sound or vibration, this app guarantees 100% reliability by controlling the mute state at the system level.
